        Micropub is an open API standard used to create posts on one's own domain using third-party clients. Web apps and native apps (e.g., iPhone, Android) can use Micropub to post short notes, photos, events or other posts to your own site.

        <h2>Author's Note</h2>
        <p>This specification was contributed to the W3C from the
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> community. More
          history and evolution of Micropub can be found on the
          <a href="https://indieweb.org/micropub">IndieWeb wiki</a>.</p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Micropub is a spec to create content on a server using web or native app clients. Micropub is primarily focused around creating "posts" (individual pieces of content such as blog posts, photos, short notes, or responses) on a website, although it can be used for other kinds of content as well. The Micropub spec defines a simple mechanism to create content, as well as a more thorough mechanism to update and delete content.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Social Web Working Group</h3>

        <p>Micropub is one of two client APIs being produced by the Social Web Working Group with slightly different use cases and approaches. Interested implementers should check out and review the other approach, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, as well.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>The Micropub vocabulary is derived directly from the [[Microformats2]]
          vocabulary. Micropub is meant to be a serialization of Microformats
          that can be submitted as an HTTP POST. The method for developing new
          Micropub vocabularies is to look at the Microformats representation
          and work backwards.</p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Conformance</h2>

      <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Conformance Classes</h3>

        <p>This section describes the conformance criteria for Micropub clients and servers. All implementations MUST support UTF-8 encoding.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Publishing Clients</h4>

          <p>A conforming Micropub client that creates posts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MUST support sending x-www-form-urlencoded requests</li>
            <li>MUST support the [[!h-entry]] vocabulary</li>
            <li>If the client creates posts by uploading file attachments, it MUST check for the presence of a Media Endpoint and if present, send the file there instead of to the Micropub endpoint</li>
            <li>SHOULD handle server error messages gracefully, presenting helpful messages to the user</li>
            <li>SHOULD support <a href="#endpoint-discovery">endpoint discovery</a> given an [[IndieAuth]] identity URL</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Editing Clients</h4>

          <p>A conforming Micropub client that edits posts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MUST support sending JSON-encoded requests</li>
            <li>MUST support the [[!h-entry]] vocabulary</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Servers</h4>

          <p>A conforming Micropub server:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>MUST support both header and form parameter methods of <a href="#authentication">authentication</a></li>
            <li>MUST support <a href="#create">creating</a> posts with the [[!h-entry]] vocabulary</li>
            <li>SHOULD support <a href="#update">updating</a> and <a href="#delete">deleting</a> posts</li>
            <li>If the server does not specify a Media Endpoint, then it MUST support x-www-form-urlencoded requests for <a href="#create">creating</a> posts</li>
          </ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria</h3>

        <p>For this specification to exit the CR stage, there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products. There is no requirement that all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the following terms:</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Client</h4>

          <p>A Micropub Client is an implementation that sends Micropub requests to create or otherwise manipulate posts. The conformance criteria are described in <a href="#conformance-classes">Conformance Classes</a> above.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Server</h4>

          <p>A Micropub Server is an implementation that can create and optionally edit and delete posts given a Micropub request. The Micropub server MAY also support a Media Endpoint for handling file uploads outside of the primary Micropub endpoint. The conformance criteria are described in <a href="#conformance-classes">Conformance Classes</a> above.</p>
        </section>        

        <section>
          <h4>Independent</h4>

          <p>Each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Interoperable</h4>

          <p>A Client and Server implementation are considered interoperable for a specific feature when the Server takes the defined action that the Client requests, the Client gets the expected response from a Server according to the feature, and the Server sends the expected response to the Client.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Implementation</h4>

          <p>An Implementation is a Micropub Client or Server which meets all of the following criteria:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>implements the corresponding conformance class of the specification</li>
            <li>is available to the general public, as downloadable software or as a hosted service</li>
            <li>is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide audience and could be used on a daily basis)</li>
            <li>is suitable for a person to use as his/her primary implementation on a website</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Feature</h4>

          <p>For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, each of the following is considered a feature:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Discovering the Micropub endpoint given the profile URL of a user</li>
            <li>Authenticating requests by including the access token in the HTTP <code>Authorization</code> header</li>
            <li>Authenticating requests by including the access token in the post body for <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> requests</li>
            <li>Limiting the ability to create posts given an access token by requiring that the access token contain at least one OAuth 2.0 scope value</li>
            <li>Creating a post using <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> syntax with one or more properties</li>
            <li>Creating a post using JSON syntax with one or more properties</li>

        <h3>Test Suite and Reporting</h3>

        <p>Please submit your implementation reports at <a href="http://micropub.net/implementation-reports/">http://micropub.net/implementation-reports/</a>. Instructions are provided at the URL. The implementation report template references the tests available at <a href="https://micropub.rocks/">micropub.rocks</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://micropub.rocks/">micropub.rocks</a> provides many test cases you can use to live-test your implementation. It also is a good tool to use while developing a Micropub implementation, as it provides detailed responses when errors are encountered.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>

      <p>As [[microformats2-parsing]] has a relatively small ruleset for parsing
        HTML documents into a data structure, Micropub similarly defines a small set of
        rules to interpret HTTP POST and GET requests as Micropub commands.
        Where [[microformats2-parsing]] does not require changing the parsing rules to
        introduce new properties of an object such as an [[h-entry]], Micropub
        similarly does not require changing parsing rules to interpret requests
        that may correspond to different post types, such as posting videos vs
        "likes".</p>
      <p>The Micropub syntax describes how to interpret HTTP POST and GET
        requests into useful server actions.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>All Micropub requests to create posts are sent as UTF-8
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#url-encoded-form-data">x-www-form-urlencoded</a>,
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#multipart-form-data">multipart form-data</a> [[!HTML5]],
          or [[!JSON]]-encoded HTTP requests. Responses typically do not include
          a response body, indicating the needed information (such as the URL
          of the created post) in HTTP headers. When a response body is necessary,
          it SHOULD be returned as a [[!JSON]] encoded object.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Reserved Properties</h3>

        <p>A few POST body property names are reserved when requests are sent as x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart form data.</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>access_token</code> - the OAuth Bearer token authenticating the request (the access token may be sent in an HTTP Authorization header or this form parameter)</li>
            <li><code>h</code> - used to specify the object type being created</li>
            <li><code>q</code> - used to query a Micropub endpoint</li>
            <li><code>url</code> - indicates the URL of the object being changed</li>
            <li><code>action</code> - indicates whether this is a <code>delete</code>, or <code>undelete</code></li>
            <li><code>mp-*</code> - reserved for future use</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>When creating posts, all other properties in the request are considered properties of the object being created.</p>
        <p class="note">The server MUST NOT store the <code>access_token</code> property in the post.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Create</h3>

        <p>To create a post, send an HTTP POST request to the Micropub endpoint indicating the type of post you are creating, as well as specifying the properties of the post. If no type is specified, the default type [[!h-entry]] SHOULD be used. Clients and servers MUST support creating posts using the x-www-form-urlencoded encoding, and MAY also support creating posts using the <a href="#json-syntax">JSON syntax</a>.</p>

        <p><pre><code>h={Microformats object type}</code></pre></p>
        <p>e.g., <code>h=entry</code></p>
        <p>All parameters not beginning with "mp-" are properties of the object being created.</p>
        <p>e.g., <code>content=hello+world</code></p>
        <p>To specify multiple values for a property, such as multiple categories of an h-entry, use array bracket notation for the property name.</p>
        <p>e.g., <code>category[]=foo&amp;category[]=bar</code></p>
        <p>Properties that accept multiple values MUST also accept a single value as a string. A complete example of a form-encoded request follows.</p>
        <p><pre class="example">h=entry&amp;content=hello+world&amp;category[]=foo&amp;category[]=bar</pre></p>

        <section>
          <h4>Uploading Files</h4>

          <p>To upload files, the client MUST check for the presence of a <a href="#media-endpoint">Media Endpoint</a>. If there is no Media Endpoint, the client can assume that the Micropub endpoint accepts files directly, and can send the request to it directly, To upload a file to the Micropub endpoint, format the whole request as multipart/form-data and send the file(s) as a standard property.</p>
          <p>For example, to upload a photo with a caption, send a request that contains three parts, named <code>h</code>, <code>content</code> and <code>photo</code>.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">multipart/form-data; boundary=553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c

--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="h"

entry
--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="content"

Hello World!
--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="photo"; filename="aaronpk.png"
Content-Type: image/png
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

... (binary data) ...
--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c--</pre></p>

          <p>For properties that can accept a file upload (such as <code>photo</code> or <code>video</code>), the Micropub endpoint MUST also accept a URL value, treating that the same as if the file had been uploaded directly. The endpoint MAY download a copy of the file at the URL and store it the same way it would store the file if it had been uploaded directly. For example:</p>

          <p><pre class="example">h=entry&amp;content=hello+world&amp;photo=https://photos.example.com/592829482876343254.jpg</pre></p>

          <p>This is to support uploading files via a Media Endpoint, or by reference to other external images. See the <a href="#media-endpoint">Media Endpoint</a> section for more information.</p>

          <p class="note">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> has raised an issue requesting examples of how to include accessibility-related information such as image alt text when creating posts that contain an image. Please see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/Micropub/issues/34">Issue 34</a> to track the progress of this issue.</p>

          <h4>JSON Syntax</h4>

          <p>Alternately, you can create a post with JSON syntax by sending the entry in the parsed Microformats 2 JSON format.</p>
          <p>Note that in this case, you cannot also upload a file, you can only reference files by URL as described above.</p>
          <p>When creating posts in JSON format, all values MUST be specified as arrays, identical to the Microformats 2 JSON format.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">{
  "type": ["h-entry"],
  "properties": {
    "content": ["hello world"],
    "category": ["foo","bar"],
    "photo": ["https://photos.example.com/592829482876343254.jpg"]
  }
}</pre></p>

        <section>
          <h4>Nested Microformats Objects</h4>

          <p>Whenever possible, nested Microformats objects should be avoided. A
            better alternative is to reference objects by their URLs. The most common
            example is including an h-card for a venue, such as checking in to a location
            or tagging a photo with a person or location. In these cases, it is
            better to reference the object by URL, creating it first if necessary.</p>

          <p>This technique has the advantage of ensuring that each object that is
            created has its own URL (each piece of data has its own link). This also
            gives the server an opportunity to handle each entity separately.
            E.g., rather than creating a duplicate of an existing venue, it may
            give back a link to one that was already created, possibly even
            merging newly received data first.</p>

          <p>In some cases, it does not make sense for the nested object to have
            a URL. For example, when posting an h-measure value, there is no
            reason for the h-measure itself to have a URL, so this is an acceptable
            case to use the nested Microformats object syntax.</p>

          <p>The example below creates a new "weight" measurement post as an
            h-entry with a h-measure objects to describe the weight and bodyfat values.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">h=entry
&amp;summary=Weighed+70.64+kg
&amp;weight[type]=h-measure
&amp;weight[properties][num]=70.64
&amp;weight[properties][unit]=kg
&amp;bodyfat[type]=h-measure
&amp;bodyfat[properties][num]=19.83
&amp;bodyfat[properties][unit]=%</pre></p>

<p><pre class="example">{
  "type": ["h-entry"],
  "properties": {
    "summary": [
      "Weighed 70.64 kg"
    ],
    "weight": [
      {
        "type": ["h-measure"],
        "properties": {
          "num": ["70.64"],
          "unit": ["kg"]
        }
      }
    ],
    "bodyfat": [
      {
        "type": ["h-measure"],
        "properties": {
          "num": ["19.83"],
          "unit": ["%"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre></p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Unrecognized Properties</h4>

          <p>If the request includes properties that the server does not recognize, it SHOULD 
          create the post anyway with any values that are recognized, and SHOULD
          store the unrecognized values internally, and return them when queried.</p>

          <p>This allows clients to post rich types of content to servers that recognize it, 
          while also posting fallback content to servers that don't.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Response</h4>

          <p>When the post is created, the Micropub endpoint MUST return either
            an <code>HTTP 201 Created</code> status code or <code>HTTP 202 Accepted</code>
            code, and MUST return a <code>Location</code> header indicating the
            URL of the created post. [[!RFC2616]]</p>

          <p><pre class="example">HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://aaronpk.example/post/1000</pre></p>

          <p>If the endpoint chooses to process the request asynchronously rather
            than creating and storing the post immediately, it MUST return an
            <code>HTTP 202 Accepted</code> status code, and MUST also return
            the <code>Location</code> header in this case. If the server is
            going to return 202, it MUST ensure the object will be created
            successfully prior to returning 202, as clients will expect the
            object at the indicated URL to exist at some point in the (near)
            future. In other words, the server must do any error checking
            and validation before returning 202.</p>

          <p>If the target also provides a shortlink, or if it syndicated the
            post to another location, the Micropub endpoint MAY return additional
            URLs using the HTTP Link header, along with an appropriate "rel" value.
            For example, it can return the short URL of a post by responding with:
            <pre>Link: &lt;http://aaron.pk/xxxxx&gt;; rel="shortlink"</pre> or
            can include the location of the syndicated post with:
            <pre>Link: &lt;https://myfavoritesocialnetwork.example/aaronpk/xxxxxx&gt;; rel="syndication"</pre></p>

          <h5>Error Response</h5>

          <p>See the "Error Responses" section below for details on how to indicate an error occurred.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Update</h3>

        <p>Micropub servers SHOULD support updating posts, including adding and 
          removing individual properties as described in this section.</p>

        <p>Updating entries is done with a JSON post describing the changes to make.</p>

        <p>To update an entry, send <code>"action": "update"</code> and specify the
          URL of the entry that is being updated using the "url" property.
          The request MUST also include either a <code>replace</code>,
          <code>add</code> or <code>delete</code> property containing the updates to make.</p>
        
        <p>The values of each property inside the <code>replace</code>, <code>add</code>
          or <code>delete</code> keys MUST be an array, even if there is only a single value.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Replace</h4>

          <p>Replace all values of the property. If the property does not exist already, it is created.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "update",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/post/100",
  "replace": {
    "content": ["hello moon"]
  }
}</pre></p>
          <p>This will replace the entire entry content with the new text.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Add</h4>

          <p>If there are any existing values for this property, they are not
            changed, the new values are added. If the property does not
            exist already, it is created.</p>

          <h5>Adding a syndication URL</h5>
          <p>Use case: adding a syndication link to a post after it has been
            published. For example, when a client supports posting first then
            syndicating to MyFavoriteSocialNetwork or Wikimedia after the fact,
            the site needs a way to update the original post with the new syndication URL.</p>
          <p>To add syndication URLs, include one or more URLs in the update request.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "update",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb",
  "add": {
    "syndication": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20040104110725/https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb"]
  }
}</pre></p>

          <h5>Adding Tags</h5>
          <p>Use case: adding tags to a post after it's been created.</p>
          <p>To add multiple values to a property (such as category), provide the new values in an array.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "update",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb",
  "add": {
    "category": ["webmention","indieweb"]
  }
}</pre></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Remove</h4>

          <p>If the property exists, remove it. This completely removes the specified property.</p>
          <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "update",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb",
  "delete": ["category"]
}</pre></p>

          <p>For properties with multiple values, such as categories, you can
            remove individual entries by value. If no values remain, the
            property is removed.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "update",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb",
  "delete": {
    "category": ["indieweb"]
  }
}</pre></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Response</h4>

          <p>The server MUST respond to successful update requests with HTTP 200, 201 or 204. If the update operation caused the URL of the post to change, the server MUST respond with HTTP 201 and include the new URL in the HTTP <code>Location</code> header. Otherwise, the server MUST respond with 200 or 204, depending on whether the response body has content. No body is required in the response, but the response MAY contain a JSON object describing the changes that were made.</p>

        </section>

      </section> <!-- Updating -->

      <section>
        <h3>Delete</h3>

        <p>Micropub servers SHOULD support deleting posts, and MAY support undeleting posts.</p>

        <p>To delete an entire entry at a URL, send a POST request containing
          <code>action=delete</code> and the URL of the item in the
          <code>url</code> property.</p>

        <p><pre class="example">action=delete
&amp;url=https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb</pre></p>
        <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "delete",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb"
}</pre></p>

        <p>To undelete a post, use "undelete" as the action.</p>
        <p><pre class="example">action=undelete
&amp;url=https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb</pre></p>
        <p><pre class="example">{
  "action": "undelete",
  "url": "https://aaronpk.example/2014/06/01/9/indieweb"
}</pre></p>

      <section>
        <h3>Media Endpoint</h3>

        <p>In order to provide a better user experience for Micropub applications, as well as to overcome the limitation of being unable to upload a file with the JSON syntax, a Micropub server MAY support a "Media Endpoint". The role of the Media Endpoint is exclusively to handle file uploads and return a URL that can be used in a subsequent Micropub request.</p>

        <p>When a Micropub server supports a Media Endpoint, clients can start uploading a photo or other media right away while the user is still creating other parts of the post. The diagram below illustrates a user interface that demonstrates creating a photo post while the photo is uploading asynchronously.</p>

        <p><img src="micropub-photo-app-flow.png" style="width:100%;" alt="A four-panel diagram of an application illustrating the main view of the application, choosing a photo to upload, uploading the photo to the Media Endpoint while the user enters text, then posting the post contents and photo URL to the Micropub endpoint."></p>

        <p>The above user flow applies just as well to mobile apps as it does to desktop apps. In general, the user experience of an application can be improved by having more of the work done asynchronously, giving the user a chance to continue working instead of waiting for the system to finish.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Discovery</h4>

          <p>To advertise that the Micropub endpoint supports a Media Endpoint, the server MUST include a key called <code>media-endpoint</code> with a value of the full URL of the Media Endpoint in the Micropub <a href="#configuration">configuration request</a>. Clients MUST NOT assume the Media Endpoint is on the same domain as the Micropub endpoint.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=config
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

{
  "media-endpoint": "https://media.example.com/micropub"
}</pre></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Authentication</h4>

          <p>The Media Endpoint MUST accept the same access tokens that the Micropub endpoint accepts.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Request</h4>

          <p>To upload a file to the Media Endpoint, the client sends a <code>multipart/form-data</code> request with one part named <code>file</code>. The Media Endpoint MAY ignore the suggested filename that the client sends.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">multipart/form-data; boundary=553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c

--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="sunset.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

... (binary data) ...
--553d9cee2030456a81931fb708ece92c--</pre></p>

          <p class="note">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> has raised an issue requesting examples of how to include accessibility-related information such as image alt text when creating posts that contain an image. Please see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/Micropub/issues/34">Issue 34</a> to track the progress of this issue.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Response</h4>

          <p>The Media Endpoint processes the file upload, storing it in whatever backend it wishes, and generates a URL to the file. The URL SHOULD be unguessable, such as using a UUID in the path. If the request is successful, the endpoint MUST return the URL to the file that was created in the HTTP <code>Location</code> header, and respond with <code>HTTP 201 Created</code>. The response body is left undefined.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://media.example.com/file/ff176c461dd111e6b6ba3e1d05defe78.jpg</pre></p>

          <p>The Micropub client can then use this URL as the value of e.g. the "photo" property of a Micropub request.</p>

          <p>The Media Endpoint MAY periodically delete files uploaded if they are not used in a Micropub request within a specific amount of time.</p>

        </section>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Querying</h3>

        <p>Micropub clients may need to query the Micropub endpoint to discover
          its capabilities, such as finding a list of syndication targets that
          it displays to the user, or retrieving the source of a post to display
          in the updating interface.</p>

        <p>To query, make a <code>GET</code> request to the Micropub endpoint and use the
          <code>q</code> parameter to specify what you are querying.</p>

        <p class="note">The Micropub endpoint may include a query string such as <code>?micropub=endpoint</code>,
          so in this case, Micropub clients MUST append the <code>q</code> parameter
          instead of replacing the query string.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Configuration</h4>

          <p>When a user initially logs in to a Micropub client, the client will want to query some initial information about the user's endpoint. The client SHOULD make a query request <code>q=config</code> to obtain initial configuration information.</p>

          <p>The server SHOULD include the following information in the configuration response.</p>

          <p><ul>
            <li>The list of syndication endpoints supported (see <a href="#syndication-targets">Syndication Targets</a> for details)</li>
            <li>The Media Endpoint if supported</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=config
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

{
  "media-endpoint": "https://media.example.com/micropub",
  "syndicate-to": [
    {
      "uid": "https://myfavoritesocialnetwork.example/aaronpk",
      "name": "aaronpk on myfavoritesocialnetwork",

  ]
}</pre></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Source Content</h4>

          <p>A Micropub client can query the endpoint to return specific properties of a post. This allows a client to request only the properties it needs or knows about, supporting such uses as making an interface to add tags to a post.</p>

          <p>To query, make a <code>GET</code> request to the Micropub endpoint and set the <code>q</code> parameter to <code>source</code>, and include the URL of the post in the <code>url</code> parameter. The query can specify the list of properties being requested by setting one or more values for the <code>properties</code> key. If more than one is specified, use array bracket notation for each name, according to [[!HTML5]] URL encoding.</p>

          <p>The endpoint MUST return the response in [[!microformats2-parsing]] [[!JSON]] format, with an object named <code>properties</code>, where the keys are the names of the properties requested. If no properties are specified, then the response MUST include all properties, as well as a <code>type</code> property indicating the vocabulary of the post.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=source&amp;properties[]=published&amp;properties[]=category&amp;url=https://aaronpk.example/post/1000
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

{
  "properties": {
    "published": ["2016-02-21T12:50:53-08:00"],
    "category": [
      "foo", 
      "bar"
    ]
  }
}</pre></p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=source&amp;url=https://aaronpk.example/post/1000
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

{
  "type": "h-entry",
  "properties": {
    "published": ["2016-02-21T12:50:53-08:00"],
    "content": ["Hello World"],
    "category": [
      "foo", 
      "bar"
    ]
  }
}</pre></p>

          <h5>HTML Content</h5>

          <p>If the source of the post was written as HTML content, then the endpoint MUST return the <code>content</code> property as an object containing an <code>html</code> property. Otherwise, the endpoint MUST return a string value for the <code>content</code> property, and the client will treat the value as plain text. This matches the behavior of the values of properties in [[microformats2-parsing]].</p>

          <p>Below is an example of requesting the content of a post which was authored as HTML.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=source&amp;properties=content&amp;url=https://aaronpk.example/post/1000
Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxx

{
  "properties": {
    "content": [
      {
        "html": "&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;World&lt;/i&gt;"
      }
    ]
  }
}</pre></p>

        </section> <!-- Source Content -->

        <section>
          <h4>Syndication Targets</h4>

          <p>To return a list of supported syndication targets, set the <code>q</code> parameter to <code>syndicate-to</code>.</p>

          <p><pre>GET /micropub?q=syndicate-to</pre></p>

          <p>The endpoint MUST return the response in [[!JSON]] format, with a key of <code>syndicate-to</code> and the values being objects descriptive of the supported syndication targets.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">GET /micropub?q=syndicate-to

      }
    }
  ]
}</pre></p>
        </section>

        <p>At a minimum, a syndication destination MUST have <code>uid</code> and <code>name</code> properties. The <code>uid</code> property is opaque to the client, and is the value the client sends in the Micropub request to indicate the targets to syndicate to. The <code>name</code> property is the value the client can display to the user. The name should be unambiguously descriptive of the destination, so that if for example there are two destinations on the same service, the name can disambiguate them.</p>

        <p>The Micropub server MAY also include additional information about the destination service and user account. This is accomplished with the additional properties <code>service</code> and <code>user</code>, both of which can have three properties, <code>name</code> (a human-readable name), <code>url</code> and <code>photo</code> (both URLs).</p>

        <p>The client may use the service and user properties to enhance the display of the syndication options, for example by including the user or service photos on the syndication buttons.</p>

        <h3>Error Response</h3>

        <p>If there was an error with the request, the endpoint MUST return an appropriate HTTP status code, typically 400, 401, or 403, and MAY include a description of the error. If an error body is returned, the response body MUST be encoded as a [[!JSON]] object and include at least a single property named <code>error</code> with the value set to one of the below:</p>

        <p><ul>
          <li>HTTP 403: <code>forbidden</code> - The authenticated user does not have permission to perform this request</li>
          <li>HTTP 401: <code>insufficient_scope</code> - The scope of this token does not meet the requirements for this request. The client may wish to re-authorize the user to obtain the necessary scope. The response MAY include the "scope" attribute with the scope necessary to successfully perform this request.</li>
          <li>HTTP 400: <code>invalid_request</code> - The request is missing a required parameter, or there was a problem with a value of one of the parameters</li>
          <li>HTTP 400: <code>not_found</code> - The post with the requested URL was not found</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>The response body MAY also contain an <code>error_description</code> property with a human-readable description of the error message, used to assist the client developer in understanding the error. This is not meant to be shown to the end user.</p>

        <p>See the OAuth 2 Bearer Token [[!RFC6750]] spec for more details on the how to return error responses.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>

      <p>The vocabularies used in Micropub requests SHOULD be the vocabularies defined by [[Microformats2]]. If the Microformats2 vocabulary is used, clients and servers MUST support at least the [[!h-entry]] vocabulary. Other vocabularies with widespread usage include [[h-event]] and [[h-card]]. When creating objects, the vocabulary of the object is indicated in the parameter <code>h</code>, or <code>type</code> in the JSON syntax. If no type is provided, the server SHOULD assume a default value of <code>entry</code>.</p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Examples of Creating Objects</h3>

        <p>To indicate the object being created, use a property called <code>h</code>,
          (which would never be the name of a property of a Microformats object),
          followed by the name of the Microformats object. Examples:
          <ul>
            <li><code>h=entry</code></li>
            <li><code>h=card</code></li>
            <li><code>h=event</code></li>
            <li><code>h=cite</code></li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The following properties may be included in a request to create a new [[h-entry]]:
          <ul>
            <li>name</li>
            <li>summary</li>
            <li>content</li>
            <li>published</li>
            <li>updated</li>
            <li>category</li>
            <li>location
              <ul>
                <li>As a Geo URI [[RFC5870]], for example: <code>geo:45.51533714,-122.646538633</code></li>
                <li>As a URL that contains an [[h-card]]</li>
                <li>As a nested [[h-adr]] object</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>in-reply-to</li>
            <li>like-of</li>
            <li>repost-of</li>
            <li>syndication - Pass one or more URLs pointing to places where this entry already exists. Can be used for importing existing content to a site.</li>

            <li>mp-syndicate-to = https://myfavoritesocialnetwork.example/aaronpk, https://archive.org/, etc.
              <ul>
                <li>This property is giving a command to the Micropub endpoint, rather than just creating data, so it uses the mp- prefix.</li>

        <section>
          <h4>New Article with Embedded Images</h4>

          <p>To create an article containing embedded images, the HTML of the article should include <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags with the URLs of the images returned after uploading them to the Media Endpoint.</p>

          <h5>Upload images to the Media Endpoint</h5>

          <p>First, upload one or more images to the Media Endpoint. Typically this will happen before the article is published, such as when the user is authoring the article in a visual editor. The editor can upload the images to the Media Endpoint as soon as the user drags them into the interface, and then embed the images into the editor via the resulting URL. See <a href="#request">Uploading to the Media Endpoint</a> for an example of this request.</p>

          <p>The response after uploading the file to the Media Endpoint will be a URL that the client can use when posting the article.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://media.example.com/file/ff176c461dd111e6b6ba3e1d05defe78.jpg</pre></p>

          <p>The client can then use this URL to embed this image in an article.</p>

          <p><pre class="example">POST /micropub HTTP/1.1
Host: aaronpk.example
Content-type: application/json

{
  "type": ["h-entry"],
  "properties": {
    "content": ["&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://media.example.com/file/ff176c461dd111e6b6ba3e1d05defe78.jpg\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"]
  }
}</pre></p>

        </section>        
        <section>
          <h4>Posting Files</h4>

          <p>When a Micropub request includes a file, the entire request is
            sent in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#multipart-form-data">multipart form-data</a>
            encoding, and the file is named according to the property it corresponds with in the vocabulary, either <code>audio</code>, <code>video</code> or <code>photo</code>. A request MAY include one or more of these files.</p>

          <p>For example, a service may post a video in the <code>video</code> property as well as a single frame preview of the video in the <code>photo</code> property.</p>

          <p>In PHP, these files are accessible using the $_FILES array:
            <pre>$_FILES['video']
$_FILES['photo']
$_FILES['audio']</pre></p>

          <p>Note that there is no way to upload a file when the request body is JSON encoded. Instead, you can first send the photo to the Media Endpoint and then use the resulting URL in the JSON post.</p>

          <p>The Micropub endpoint may store the file directly, or make an external
            request to upload it to a different backend storage, such as Amazon S3.</p>

      <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Authentication</h3>

        <p>Micropub requests MUST be authenticated by including a Bearer Token in
          either the HTTP header or a form-encoded body parameter as described
          in the OAuth Bearer Token RFC. [[!RFC6750]] Micropub servers MUST accept
          the token using both methods.</p>

        <p><h5>HTTP Header</h5>
          <pre>Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXX</pre></p>

        <p><h5>Form-Encoded Body Parameter</h5>
          <pre>access_token=XXXXXXXXX</pre></p>
      </section> <!-- Authentication -->

      <section>
        <h3>Authorization</h3>

        <p>An app that wants to post to a user's Micropub endpoint will need
          to obtain authorization from the user in order to get an access token.
          Authorization SHOULD be handled via the OAuth 2.0 [[!RFC6749]] protocol,
          including the [[IndieAuth]] extension which supports endpoint discovery from a URL.
          See <a href="https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token">Obtaining an Access Token</a>
          for more details.</p>
      </section> <!-- Authorization -->

      <section>
        <h3>Endpoint Discovery</h3>

        <p>Micropub defines a link relation value of <code>micropub</code> to link to a website's
        Micropub endpoint from the profile page identifying the user.</p>

        <p>A Micropub client SHOULD be able to be configured by authenticating
          with a domain name using [[IndieAuth]]. During this authentication (and authorization),
          the client discovers the Micropub endpoint which will be used to create posts, as well
          as obtains an access token it will use in the Micropub requests.</p>

        <p>The client looks for a <code>&lt;link rel="micropub"&gt;</code> tag in the HTML head of the URL used to authenticate, 
        or sends an <code>HTTP Link</code> header with a rel value of <code>micropub</code>.</p>

        <p><h5>HTTP Link Header</h5>
          <pre>Link: &lt;https://aaronpk.example/micropub&gt;; rel="micropub"</pre></p>

        <p><h5>HTML Link Tag</h5>
          <pre>&lt;link rel="micropub" href="https://aaronpk.example/micropub"&gt;</pre></p>

      </section> <!-- Discovery -->

      <section>
        <h3>Scope</h3>

        <p>The Micropub server MUST require the bearer token to include at least one scope
          value, in order to ensure posts cannot be created by arbitrary tokens.</p>
        <p>The client may request one or more scopes during the authorization
          request. It does this according to standard OAuth 2.0 techniques,
          by passing a space-separated list of scope names in the authorization request. [[RFC6749]]</p>
        <p>The authorization server MUST indicate to the user any scopes that
          are part of the request, whether or not the authorization server
          recognizes the scopes. The authorization server MAY also allow the
          user to add or remove scopes that the client requests.</p>
        <p>Most Micropub servers require clients to obtain the
          "create" scope in order to create posts. However, some servers MAY
          require more granular scope, such as "delete", "update", or "create:video",
          in order to limit the abilities of various clients.
          See <a href="https://indieweb.org/scope">Scope</a> for more details and 
          a list of all currently used values for scope.</p>
